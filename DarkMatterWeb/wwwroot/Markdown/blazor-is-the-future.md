### Blazor is the Future
We are one of the first teams delivering Blazor Server Apps in production. Web Assembly opens up a new world of web development and we’ll be the first to deliver Blazor Client Apps as well. It’s not often that a game-changing technology comes along that radically simplifies development like Blazor. We might seem like risk-takers at the moment, but Blazor not an experiment. It’s baked into .Net and has a bright future with a very long tail.
